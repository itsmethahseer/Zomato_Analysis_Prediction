# Zomato_Analysis_Prediction

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Zomato reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used for analysis is sourced from Kaggle. Dataset link: [Zomato Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taaresh7/zomato-reviews).

## Overview

In this analysis, an additional feature called "Status" is added based on the review ratings. NLP techniques such as stemming, tokenization, and vectorization (WordVec2, Bag of Words, Count Vectorizer, and TD-IDF) are utilized for classifying users' reviews. The `Spacy` library is used for prediction.

The datasets are visualized using Python visualization libraries, including Seaborn and Matplotlib. Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes are employed for classification. Comparing the models, the Logistic Regression model achieves higher accuracy than Naive Bayes.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `files/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the step-by-step process of the analysis. Notebooks cover data preprocessing, NLP techniques, and model training and evaluation.

- `Zomato_Review_Analysis.ipynb`: Python script with the main code for sentiment analysis and prediction.


## Usage

To perform sentiment analysis on Zomato reviews, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required libraries.

3. Run the `Zomato_Review_Analysis.ipynb` script to preprocess the data, apply NLP techniques, and train the classification models.

4. Once the models are trained, you can use them to predict sentiments for new reviews.

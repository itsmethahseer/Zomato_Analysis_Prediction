Zomato Data Review Analysis With Prediction
In this Analysis i used a Dataset from Kaggle
Dataset link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taaresh7/zomato-reviews

Then i added a Extra Feature in my analysis namely Status based on the review ratings

-->I used Natural Language Processing techniques for classifying my users review such as
*Stemming
*Toeknization
*Vectorization concepts such WordVec2,Bag of Words,Count Vectorizer and TD-IDF
*I used Spacy Library for the Prediction
Then i represented my datasets using python visualization libraries such as Seaborn 
and Matplotlib.
I used Machine learning Mathematical Models such as Logistic regression and Naive 
bayes used to classification
I get More accuracy in Logistic regression Model When compared to Naive bayes.
Accuracy of Logistic Classification Model = 92.30
Accuracy of Naive Bayes Classification model = 90.76
